Analytics can be joyful and fun. It should help you take away the tedious work of dissecting graphs and calculating numbers. Analytics should feel like your assistant. With Analyze, you don’t just get charts. You’ll also see three recommended times to post on Instagram. They are times when  your predicted reach is among the highest during the week. Most people would find the three recommendations sufficient but if you want more, you can then dive into the charts."
